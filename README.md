# Spell-checker
Spell-checker is a web application that utilizes a dictionary hash table, constructed from a given database. The spell checker then parses user input after submitting the text, checking each word for proper spelling. For any misspelled words, the spell checker will provide a list of potential corrections, including adding one character in any possible position, removing one character from the word, and swapping adjacent characters in the word. Whether a word is spelled correctly or not, the spell checker will provide clear and concise feedback, making it a reliable tool for checking and correcting spelling errors. It is a work in progress.
